<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrickNv23/kitchen-display-system-challenge/main/src/assets/screenshots/home.png)

- Where can I see your demo?
  This application is an ordering system to improve the experience and speed in order processing.
- What was your experience?
  My experience was good, since the technologies used helped me create a scalable project, with good performance and a friendly interface.
- What have you learned/improved?
  I learned state management with Redux Toolkit, style management with Styled components and react project management using Typescript, these technologies are very powerful together and allow you to carry out quality projects.


### Built With

- [React](https://es.react.dev/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Awesome Reveal](https://react-awesome-reveal.morello.dev/)

## Features

- Show a list of orders.
- Each order must include basic details such as product list and quantity.
- Orders must be displayed in real time on the Kitchen Display System (currently simulated without backend).
- Implement filtering functionality to show only pending, in-process, completed or cancelled orders.
- Implement order management functionality, such as marking orders as completed or canceled.

## Good Practices

- Typed variables and typed entities.
- Separation of components and features by folders.
- Data management in external files.
- State management with reducer functions (Redux Toolkit).
- Management of global and component styles (Styled components).
- Application tests in different resolutions.
- Typed props on components.
- Images in Webp format.
